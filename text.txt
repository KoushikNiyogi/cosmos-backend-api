user : 'I have two daughters. One is 8 years and other is 3.5 years old.
Elder one is little becoming inferior. She afraid of to asking questions. She is afraid that she will be scolded if she asks questions. That’s why she doesn’t ask questions. Whether it’s studies or other things. We are also at mistake as parents. What should I do? She can’t talk to anyone without fear. '
Assistant : 'You can try 3 things:
1. Asking child why she is not asking questions? She could say that she did ask in the school but teacher scolded back. Whatever she says, you may listen. It is possible that she says no because she is scared. 
2. Then you may say her that you can ask any question to mommy. Mom will not scold her. Even if you did in the past, it will not repeat. This way, your daughter will have one person to whom she can ask questions. 
3. Check the school once whether they allow students to ask questions or not.'

Assistsnt: 'Meherr ji - sorry for the late reply. Aapki beti choti hai. Is umar mein kuch na milne pe kaise behave karna hai bachon ko pata nahin hota. Emotion pe kaabu nahin hota. Lekin bachon ka bhi maarna rok sakte hai. Thoda time laga ke.
Kabhi bhi jiss cheez ke liye bacha hit kar raha hai woh puri nahin karni kyonki phir bachey ko lagta hai ke maarne se cheez milegi. So a no means a no. But pyaar se.
Aap calm aawaaz mein usko bol sakti hai - No using hands and feet. Mujhe lagti hai. Same line hi humein baar baar use karni hai.
Phir Aap uski feeling ko acknowledge karo. Ke aapko woh chahiye. Haan? Mujhe pata hai. Mujhe pata hai aapko aacha lagta hai. Lekin maarne se kabhi nahin milega. Mummy loves you. 
Bachon ke nervous system ko touch karne se calmnes milti hai. Unko touch karke pyaar se mana karenge to baat samajne ka chance zyada hai.
Yeh sab karke hum apne bachey ko sikha rahe hai ke how to be in control of their emotions. Yeh imp learning sabse pehle maa baap se hi aati hai :-)
Lots of love to your family <heart symbol>'

Aapko kyon lagta hai ke aapki beti dukhi hai?

Rajpriya ji, the environment in your house is impacting your child. Ghar ke badao ke karan bache parr asar pad gaya haiAgar bade landenge ya bachey ko alag alag cheez bolenge ya daantenge to bacha apni feelings dabana shuru ho jayegaLikeForwardCopyUnsendHuman's ke dimaag ka ek simple udeshya hai - bachey ko safe feel karwana

Agar usko safe feel nahin hota, calm nahin feel hota, to woh dheere develop hota hai. Sochiye ke aap pareshaan hai. Jabb hum pareshaan hote hai to kaam pe focus nahin kar paate aur dukhi rehte haiwahi apki beti ke saath ho sakta haihttps://www.instagram.com/p/Co7CvllIXwy/Joint family mein agar bade sab same page pe ho, to bachey ke liye best haiLikeForwardCopyUnsendAap do teen cheezein kar sakti hai- apni beti ke saath bahar walks pe ja sakti hai, taaki aap dono ko akele aacha simple time mile- aapke husband bhi yeh kar sakte hai uske saath- aap apna relationship apne husband aur inlaws ke saath improve kar sakti hai taaki ghar mein ladayi nahin ho.

When elder left alone with younger one then he will just keeps on beating with whatever he got. But sometimes he cares for him. I don't know what to do. He doesn't want me to breastfeed feed the younger baby. And he wants me to breastfeed feed him and he only want to be with me. But iam unable to give him time because he wants me only when the younger one needs me for breastfeeding please suggest something sir'
Assistant: 'Priyanka - when the younger child comes we forget the older childYour older child only needs to know his quota of love from you is secureSo you can catch him, hold him and tell him I love you.And you can say see everyday we will spend time togetherand you can spend 15-30 min with him without your younger childthe elder one needs love coz he is missing itthat's allLikeForwardCopyUnsendand you can also involve him in saying listen we are a family. all of us together.'
user: 'Dear Harpreeth, We have a toddler (daughter) who is aged 2.9 Yrs undergoing a rough phase. The issue is that,
1. We had a nanny - 21 Yrs (Rohini) with whom our daughter enjoyed a lot, playing, signing, dancing etc. The nanny (Rohini) was also good and she played with her nicely
2. Unfortunately, she ended up leaving because of her personal problems & there was no clear closure for my daughter. The nanny was a live-in nanny.
3. Even today my daughter recalls the songs that they sang together, cherishes the games they played and remembers her at-least 6-7 times a day
4. We have replaced her with a nanny, who is much more good but aged around 35 Yrs. But this nanny is a day nanny, comes at 10 and leaves at 7. Its more than 1.5 months and my daughter has not adjusted to the new nanny. She gets irritated and reluctant to play or move with her. She has become clingy to me and my wife.
5. I am clueless, what to do? Can you please help us out.
In case, if you can be reached out through phone and provide a consultancy that would be great. Will wait for your reply.'
